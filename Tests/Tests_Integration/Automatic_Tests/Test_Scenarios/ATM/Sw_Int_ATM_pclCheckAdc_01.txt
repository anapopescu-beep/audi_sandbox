ARCH_SW_pclCheckAdc: This is the ADC autotest. It consists of checking that the two reference voltages measured on the dedicated ADC channels do not drift.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

Action: ARCH_SW_pclCheckAdc

	Step 2: Set a BP in function atm_cbk_CheckAdc at the RTE Call for CheckAdc Autotest. 
		Expected result:  BP is reached.

	Step 3: Set a BP in function AdcIf_Autotest_CheckAdc at the return of auto test status. 
		Expected result:  BP is reached.

	Step 4: Modify the autotest result with value KU8_ATM_TEST_OK. 
		Expected result:  BP is reached.

	Step 5: Set a BP in function atm_cbk_CheckAdc after the RTE Call for CheckAdc Autotest. 
		Expected result:  BP is reached.

	Step 6: Check that u8TestResult is equal to KU8_ATM_TEST_OK. 
		Expected result:  Variable is set to 1.

Postcondition

	Step 7: Return ECU to default values
