Requirement under test: ARCH_SW_pclEcuOverTemperature
ARCH_SW_pclEcuOverTemperature: This is the autotest to check over temperature of MCU.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

Action: ARCH_SW_pclEcuOverTemperature

	Step 2: Set a BP in function atm_cbk_runOverTemperature at the RTE Call for EcuOverTemperature Autotest. 
		Expected result:  BP is reached.

	Step 3: Set a BP in function IoHwAb_CheckEcuOverTemperatureAutotest at the return of auto test status. 
		Expected result:  BP is reached.

	Step 4: Modify the autotest result with value KU8_ATM_TEST_OK. 
		Expected result:  BP is reached.

	Step 5: Set a BP in function atm_cbk_runOverTemperature after the RTE Call for EcuOverTemperature Autotest. 
		Expected result:  BP is reached.

	Step 6: Check that u8TestResult is equal to KU8_ATM_TEST_OK. 
		Expected result:  Variable is set to 0x1.

Postcondition

	Step 7: Return ECU to default values
