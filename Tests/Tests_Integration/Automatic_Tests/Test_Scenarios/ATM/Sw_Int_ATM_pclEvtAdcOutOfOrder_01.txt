--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

Action: ARCH_SW_pclEvtAdcOutOfOrder

	Step 2: Set a BP in function atm_SetDemEvent at the switch statement. 
		Expected result:  BP is reached.

	Step 3: Modify the Id of autotest with ATM_KU8_ID_TEST_ADC_OUT_OF_ORDER

	Step 4: Set a BP in function Dem_SetEventStatus at the result of event status. 
		Expected result:  BP is reached.

Postcondition

	Step 5: Return ECU to default values
