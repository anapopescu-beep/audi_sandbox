--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

Action: ARCH_SW_pclRunEepromMemoryNotProgrammed

	Step 2: Set a BP in function atm_cbk_RunEepromMemoryNotProgrammed_NVMIF_Autotest at the RTE Call for EepromMemoryNotProgrammed Autotest. 
		Expected result:  BP is reached.

	Step 3: Soft Reset the ECU 
		Expected result:  ECU is reset

	Step 4: Set a BP in function NvmIf_Autotest_RunEepromMemoryNotProgrammed at the return of auto test status. 
		Expected result:  BP is reached.

	Step 5: Modify the autotest result with value KU8_ATM_TEST_OK. 
		Expected result:  BP is reached.

	Step 6: Set a BP in function atm_cbk_RunEepromMemoryNotProgrammed_NVMIF_Autotest after the RTE Call for EepromMemoryNotProgrammed Autotest. 
		Expected result:  BP is reached.

	Step 7: Check that u8TestResult is equal to KU8_ATM_TEST_OK. 
		Expected result:  Variable is set to 0x1.

Postcondition

	Step 8: Return ECU to default values
