Nightly test: No
Test type: Requirement-Based, Interface Test
Regression Test: No
Fault injection method used: No
Resource usage evaluation: No
Priority: No
Safety relevant: No
Requirement under test: ARCH_SW_AdcIf_pseCheckAdc, ARCH_SW_pclCheckAdc
ARCH_SW_AdcIf_pseCheckAdc: The autotest shall read the low and high voltage refference for the ADC peripheral via the {AdcIf_runGetChannelValue} runnable and will compare them with thresholds stored in the NvM memory({NVP_u16ADCLowVoltageThrs}, {NVP_u16ADCHighVoltageThrs}). Comparison shall be done in mV.
ARCH_SW_pclCheckAdc: This is the ADC autotest. It consists of checking that the two reference voltages measured on the dedicated ADC channels do not drift.

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

Action: ARCH_SW_AdcIf_pseCheckAdc, ARCH_SW_pclCheckAdc

	Step 2: Set a breakpoint in function AdcIf_runGetChannelValue in order to read the low and high voltage refference 
		Expected result:  BP reached.

	Step 3: Set a breakpoint in function AdcIf_Autotest_CheckAdc at the if statement 
		Expected result:  BP reached.

	Step 4: Modify the NVP ADC Low Voltage Reference variable 
		Expected result:  Variable was written with 1.

	Step 5: Modify the NVP ADC High Voltage Reference variable 
		Expected result:  Variable was written with 0x12.

	Step 6: Set a breakpoint in function atm_cbk_CheckAdc in order to read autotest result 
		Expected result:  BP reached.

	Step 7: Evaluate test case result 
		Expected result:  Variable is set to 0x2.

Postcondition

	Step 8: Return ECU to default values
