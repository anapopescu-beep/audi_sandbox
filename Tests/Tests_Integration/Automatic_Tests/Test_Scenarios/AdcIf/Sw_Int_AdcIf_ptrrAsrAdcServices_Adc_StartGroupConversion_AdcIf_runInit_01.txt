Requirement under test: ARCH_SW_AdcIf_ptrrAsrAdcServices_Adc_StartGroupConversion_AdcIf_runInit, ARCH_SW_AdcIf_ptrrAsrAdcServices_Adc_StartGroupConversion_AdcIf_GPTOnTimer_Expiration, ARCH_SW_AdcIf_ptrrAsrAdcServices_Adc_Calibrate, ARCH_SW_AdcIf_ptrrAsrAdcServices_AdcIf_runDeInit, ARCH_SW_AdcIf_ptrrAsrAdcServices_Adc_ReadGroup
ARCH_SW_AdcIf_ptrrAsrAdcServices_Adc_StartGroupConversion_AdcIf_runInit: The Adc_StartGroupConversion runnable shall be called in the AdcIf_runInit runnable in order to start the first conversion.
ARCH_SW_AdcIf_ptrrAsrAdcServices_Adc_StartGroupConversion_AdcIf_GPTOnTimer_Expiration: The Adc_StartGroupConversion runnable shall be called in the AdcIf_GPTOnTimer_Expiration runnable in order to start the periodic conversion.
ARCH_SW_AdcIf_ptrrAsrAdcServices_Adc_Calibrate: The Adc_Calibrate runnable shall be called in the AdcIf_Calib runnable in order to calibrate the Adc hw units according to the S32k datasheet. The runnable shall store the calibration status for both hw units.
ARCH_SW_AdcIf_ptrrAsrAdcServices_AdcIf_runDeInit: The Adc_StopGroupConversion runnable shall be called in the AdcIf_runDeInit runnable in order to stop the group conversion before ECU shutdown.
ARCH_SW_AdcIf_ptrrAsrAdcServices_Adc_ReadGroup: The Adc_ReadGroup runnable shall be called in the AdcIf_GPTOnTimer_Expiration runnable in order to get the lsb value from the Adc groups.
