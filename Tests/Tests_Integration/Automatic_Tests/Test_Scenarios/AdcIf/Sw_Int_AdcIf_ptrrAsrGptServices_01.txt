Nightly test: No
Test type: Requirement-Based, Interface Test
Regression Test: No
Fault injection method used: No
Resource usage evaluation: No
Priority: No
Safety relevant: No
Requirement under test: ARCH_SW_AdcIf_ptrrAsrGptServices, ARCH_SW_AdcIf_ptrpAsrGptServices
ARCH_SW_AdcIf_ptrrAsrGptServices: The Gpt_Init runnable shall be called in the AdcIf_runInit runnable in order to initialize the Gpt component. The Gpt_StartTimer runnable shall be called in the AdcIf_runInit runnable in order to start the timer that will trigger the Adc conversion. The Gpt_EnableNotification runnable shall be called in the AdcIf_runInit runnable in order to enable the notification on the timer expiration event.
ARCH_SW_AdcIf_ptrpAsrGptServices: The AdcIf_GPTOnTimer_Expiration runnable shall be called when the Gpt timer expires via the Gpt_InitChannelPB_TDK_4G runnable.

	Step 3: Set a breakpoint in function AdcIf_runInit at Gpt_EnableNotification function call 
		Expected result:  BP is reached.

	Step 4: Set a breakpoint in function AdcIf_runInit at Gpt_StartTimer function call 
		Expected result:  BP is reached.

Action: ARCH_SW_AdcIf_ptrpAsrGptServices

	Step 5: Set a breakpoint in function AdcIf_runInit at Gpt_Init function call 
		Expected result:  BP is reached.

	Step 6: Set a breakpoint in function AdcIf_GPTOnTimer_Expiration at ADCIF_EndOfConvGroup0 function call 
		Expected result:  BP is reached.

Postcondition

	Step 7: Return ECU to default values
