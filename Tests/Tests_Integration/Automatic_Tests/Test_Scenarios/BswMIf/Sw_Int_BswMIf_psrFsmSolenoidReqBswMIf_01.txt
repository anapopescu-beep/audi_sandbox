Action: ARCH_SW_BswMIf_psrFsmSolenoidReqBswMIf_BswM_OnSafeStateFromPostRun

	Step 2: Enable comunication 
		Expected result:  Comunication enable

	Step 3: Disable comunication 
		Expected result:  Comunication disable

	Step 4: Set a BP in function BswM_Cyclic_10msTimer in order to go in  BswM_OnLowPwrFromPostRun function 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 5: Set a BP in function BswM_Action_BswMAction_BswM_OnSafeStateFromPostRun in order to call BswM_OnSafeStateFromPostRun  function 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 6: Set a BP in function BswM_OnSafeStateFromPostRun  in order to write the interface in order to trigger an unlock/lock for a certain solenoid 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 7: Set a BP in function Rte_Write_BswMIf_psrFsmSolenoidReqBswMIf_ab8DiagReq for check the interface 
		Expected result:  BP was set

Postcondition

	Step 8: Return ECU to default values
