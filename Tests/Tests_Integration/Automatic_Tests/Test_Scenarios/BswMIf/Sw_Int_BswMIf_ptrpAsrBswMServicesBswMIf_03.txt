--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

Action: ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrpAsrBswMServicesBswMIf_BswM_On_Prep_Shutdown

	Step 2: Enable comunication 
		Expected result:  Comunication enable

	Step 3: Disable comunication 
		Expected result:  Comunication disable

	Step 4: Set a BP in function BswM_Cyclic_10msTimer in order to change post run timer value 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 5: Change value for Post Run Timer in order to go in LPM_sleepMainLoop function 
		Expected result:  Succesfully changed

	Step 6: Set a BP in function LPM_sleepMainLoop in order to change Timer value 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 7: Change value for timer 
		Expected result:  Succesfully changed

	Step 8: Set a BP in function BswM_Action_BswMAction_BswM_On_Prep_Shutdown in order to call BswM_On_Prep_Shutdown function 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 9: Set a BP in function BswM_On_Prep_Shutdown  in order to check if Post Run timer exceed his maximum value AND buckle and SBS sensors are not available - Low Power timer exceed his maximum value AND no valid passenger occupancy or bus activity was detected 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 10: Set a BP in function BswM_Action_BswMAction_BswM_On_Prep_Shutdown for check the interface 
		Expected result:  BP was set

Postcondition

	Step 11: Return ECU to default values
