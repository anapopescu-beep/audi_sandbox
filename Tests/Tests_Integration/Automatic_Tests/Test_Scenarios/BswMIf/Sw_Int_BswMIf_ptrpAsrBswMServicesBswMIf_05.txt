ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrpAsrBswMServicesBswMIf_BswM_OnLowPwrFromPostRun: The BswM_OnLowPwrFromPostRun runnable shall be called by the Autosar BswM in case of: - Low Power state is requested {current state of ECU is POST RUN State}.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

Action: ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrpAsrBswMServicesBswMIf_BswM_OnLowPwrFromPostRun

	Step 2: Enable comunication 
		Expected result:  Comunication enable

	Step 3: Disable comunication 
		Expected result:  Comunication disable

	Step 4: Set a BP in function BswM_Cyclic_10msTimer in order to change post run timer value 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 5: Change value for Post Run Timer in order to go in BswM_Action_BswMAction_BswM_LowPwrStateFromPostRun function 
		Expected result:  Succesfully changed

	Step 6: Set a BP in function BswM_Action_BswMAction_BswM_LowPwrStateFromPostRun in order to call BswM_OnLowPwrFromPostRun function 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 7: Set a BP in function BswM_OnLowPwrFromPostRun in order to check if Low Power state was requested {current state of ECU is POST RUN State} 
		Expected result:  BP was set

Postcondition

	Step 8: Return ECU to default values
