Requirement under test: ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrpAsrBswMServicesBswMIf_BswM_OnRunFromLowPwrPassengerDetected
ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrpAsrBswMServicesBswMIf_BswM_OnRunFromLowPwrPassengerDetected: The BswM_OnRunFromLowPwrPassengerDetected runnable shall be called by the Autosar BswM in case of: - The current state of ECU is LOW POWER AND an Active wakeup is detected {passenger occupancy detected}.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

Action: ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrpAsrBswMServicesBswMIf_BswM_OnRunFromLowPwrPassengerDetected

	Step 2: Enable comunication 
		Expected result:  Comunication enable

	Step 3: Disable comunication 
		Expected result:  Comunication disable

	Step 4: Set a BP in function BswM_Cyclic_10msTimer in order to change post run timer value 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 5: Change value for Post Run Timer in order to go in LPM_sleepMainLoop function 
		Expected result:  Succesfully changed

	Step 6: Set a BP in function LPM_sleepMainLoop in order to change Adc Wakeup value 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 7: Change value for Adc wakeup in True 
		Expected result:  Succesfully changed

	Step 8: Set a BP in function BswM_Action_BswMAction_BswM_RunStateFromLowPwr_ActiveWake in order to call BswM_OnRunFromLowPwrPassengerDetected function 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 9: Set a BP in function BswM_OnRunFromLowPwrPassengerDetected in order to check Bus if Current state of ECU is RUN AND Bus communication timeout was received 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 10: Set a BP in function BswM_Action_BswMAction_BswM_RunStateFromLowPwr_ActiveWake in order to check the interface 
		Expected result:  BP was set

Postcondition

	Step 11: Return ECU to default values
