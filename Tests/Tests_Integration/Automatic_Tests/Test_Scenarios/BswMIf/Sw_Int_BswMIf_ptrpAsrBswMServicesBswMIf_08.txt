ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrpAsrBswMServicesBswMIf_BswM_OnDisableTxPdu:  The BswM_OnDisableTxPdu runnable shall be called by the Autosar BswM in case of: - Current state of ECU is RUN AND Bus communication timeout is received
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

Action: ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrpAsrBswMServicesBswMIf_BswM_OnDisableTxPdu

	Step 2: Disable comunication 
		Expected result:  Comunication disable

	Step 3: Set a BP in function BswM_Action_BswMAction_ComM_DisableTxPduConfirmation in order to call BswM_OnDisableTxPdu function 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 4: Set a BP in function BswM_OnDisableTxPdu in order to check Bus if Current state of ECU is RUN AND Bus communication timeout was received 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 5: Set a BP in function BswM_Action_BswMAction_ComM_DisableTxPduConfirmation in order to check the interface 
		Expected result:  BP was set

Postcondition

	Step 6: Return ECU to default values
