Requirement under test: ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrpAsrBswMServicesBswMIf_BswM_OnRunFromLowPwrBusAvailable
ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrpAsrBswMServicesBswMIf_BswM_OnRunFromLowPwrBusAvailable: The BswM_OnRunFromLowPwrBusAvailable runnable shall be called by the Autosar BswM in case of: - The current state of ECU is LOW POWER AND a Passive wakeup is detected {CAN Bus activity}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

Action: ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrpAsrBswMServicesBswMIf_BswM_OnRunFromLowPwrBusAvailable

	Step 2: Enable comunication 
		Expected result:  Comunication enable

	Step 3: Disable comunication 
		Expected result:  Comunication disable

	Step 4: Set a BP in function BswM_Cyclic_10msTimer in order to go in  BswM_OnLowPwrFromPostRun function 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 5: Set a BP in function BswM_OnLowPwrFromPostRun in order to go in BswM_Action_BswMAction_BswM_RunStateFromLowPwr_PassiveWake function 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 6: Enable comunication 
		Expected result:  Comunication enable

	Step 7: Set a BP in function BswM_Action_BswMAction_BswM_RunStateFromLowPwr_PassiveWake in order to call BswM_OnPostRunFromRun function 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 8: Set a BP in function BswM_OnRunFromLowPwrBusAvailable in order to check if The current state of ECU is LOW POWER AND a Passive wakeup was detected {CAN Bus activity} 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 9: Set a BP in function BswM_Action_BswMAction_BswM_RunStateFromLowPwr_PassiveWake in order to check the interface 
		Expected result:  BP was set

Postcondition

	Step 10: Return ECU to default values
