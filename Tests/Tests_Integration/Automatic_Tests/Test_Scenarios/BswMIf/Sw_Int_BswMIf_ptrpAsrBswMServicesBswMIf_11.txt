Requirement under test: ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrpAsrBswMServicesBswMIf_BswM_OnStartupTwoB
ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrpAsrBswMServicesBswMIf_BswM_OnStartupTwoB: The BswM_OnStartupTwoB runnable shall be called by the Autosar BswM in case of: - ReadAll NvM procedure is made {After second part of ECU initialization - BswM_OnStartupTwoB}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

Action: ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrpAsrBswMServicesBswMIf_BswM_OnStartupTwoB

	Step 2: Set a BP in function BswM_Action_BswMAction_BswM_OnStartupTwoB in order execute ReadAll NvM procedure 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 3: Set a BP in function BswM_Action_BswMAction_BswM_OnStartupTwoB in order to call BswM_OnStartupTwoB function 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 4: Set a BP in function BswM_OnStartupTwoB in order to check if ReadAll NvM procedure was made
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 5: Set a BP in function BswM_Action_BswMAction_BswM_OnStartupTwoB in order to check the interface 
		Expected result:  BP was set

Postcondition

	Step 6: Return ECU to default values
