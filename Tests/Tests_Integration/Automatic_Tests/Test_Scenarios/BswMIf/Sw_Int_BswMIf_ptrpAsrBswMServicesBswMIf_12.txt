ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrpAsrBswMServicesBswMIf_BswM_OnStartComEffective: The BswM_OnStartComEffective runnable shall be called by the Autosar BswM in case of: - Bus communication is available AND wakeup was validated
ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrpAsrBswMServicesBswMIf_BswM_OnRunFromWakeup: The BswM_OnRunFromWakeup runnable shall be called by the Autosar BswM in case of: - Wakeup is validated and all modules were initialized {BswM_OnStartComEffective}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

Action: ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrpAsrBswMServicesBswMIf_BswM_OnStartComEffective

	Step 2: Set a BP in function BswM_Action_BswMAction_BswM_OnStartComEffective in order call BswM_OnStartComEffective function 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 3: Set a BP in function BswM_OnStartComEffective in order to check Bus if communication is available AND wakeup was validated 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 4: Set a BP in function BswM_Action_BswMAction_BswM_OnStartComEffective in order to check the interface 
		Expected result:  BP was set

Action: ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrpAsrBswMServicesBswMIf_BswM_OnRunFromWakeup

	Step 5: Set a BP in function BswM_Action_BswMAction_BswM_RunStateFromWakeup in order call BswM_OnRunFromWakeup function 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 6: Set a BP in function BswM_OnRunFromWakeup in order to check Bus if Wakeup is validated and all modules were initialized 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 7: Set a BP in function BswM_Action_BswMAction_BswM_RunStateFromWakeup in order to check the interface 
		Expected result:  BP was set

Postcondition

	Step 8: Return ECU to default values
