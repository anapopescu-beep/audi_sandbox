Requirement under test: ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrpAsrBswMServicesBswMIf_BswM_OnRunFromPostRunPassengerDetected
ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrpAsrBswMServicesBswMIf_BswM_OnRunFromPostRunPassengerDetected: The BswM_OnRunFromPostRunPassengerDetected runnable shall be called by the Autosar BswM in case of: - The current state of ECU is POST RUN AND Valid Passenger occupancy is detected
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

Action: ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrpAsrBswMServicesBswMIf_BswM_OnRunFromPostRunPassengerDetected

	Step 2: Enable comunication 
		Expected result:  Comunication enable

	Step 3: Disable comunication 
		Expected result:  Comunication disable

	Step 4: Set a BP in function BswM_Cyclic_10msTimer in order to change post run timer value 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 5: Set a BP in function BswM_Cyclic_10msTimer in order to change Passenger Occupancy Status value 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 6: Change value for Passenger Occupancy Status with pasager occupancy is detected
		Expected result:  Succesfully changed

	Step 7: Set a BP in function BswM_Cyclic_10msTimer in order to call BswM_RequestMode function 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 8: Set a BP in function BswM_Action_BswMAction_BswM_RunStateFromPostRunPassengerDetected in order to call BswM_OnRunFromPostRunPassengerDetected function 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 9: Set a BP in function BswM_OnRunFromPostRunPassengerDetected in order to check Bus if communication is available AND wakeup was validated 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 10: Set a BP in function BswM_Action_BswMAction_BswM_RunStateFromPostRunPassengerDetected in order to check the interface 
		Expected result:  BP was set

Postcondition

	Step 11: Return ECU to default values
