ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrpAsrBswMServicesBswMIf_BswM_OnRunFromPostRunBusAvailable: The BswM_OnRunFromPostRunBusAvailable runnable shall be called by the Autosar BswM in case of: - The current state of ECU is POST RUN AND Bus communication is available {reception aknowledge is received}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

Action: ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrpAsrBswMServicesBswMIf_BswM_OnRunFromPostRunBusAvailable

	Step 2: Disable comunication 
		Expected result:  Comunication disable

	Step 3: Set a BP in function BswM_OnPostRunFromRun in order to call BswM_RequestMode function 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 4: Enable comunication 
		Expected result:  Comunication enable

	Step 5: Set a BP in function BswM_Action_BswMAction_BswM_RunStateFromPostRunBusAvailable in order to call BswM_OnRunFromPostRunPassengerDetected function 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 6: Set a BP in function BswM_OnRunFromPostRunBusAvailable in order to check if The current state of ECU is POST RUN AND Bus communication is available 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 7: Set a BP in function BswM_Action_BswMAction_BswM_RunStateFromPostRunBusAvailable in order to check the interface 
		Expected result:  BP was set

Postcondition

	Step 8: Return ECU to default values
