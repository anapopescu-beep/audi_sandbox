Requirement under test: ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrpAsrBswMServices_BswMIf_BswM_OnStartupTwoA
ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrpAsrBswMServices_BswMIf_BswM_OnStartupTwoA: The BswM_OnStartupTwoA runnable shall be called by the Autosar BswM in case of: - First part of ECU initialization is done {EcuM_StartupOne, EcuM_StartupTwo}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

Action: ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrpAsrBswMServices_BswMIf_BswM_OnStartupTwoA

	Step 2: Set a BP in function BswM_Action_BswMAction_BswM_OnStartupTwoA in order to call BswM_OnStartupTwoA function 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 3: Set a BP in function BswM_OnStartupTwoA in order to check if First part of ECU initialization was done 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 4: Set a BP in function BswM_Action_BswMAction_BswM_OnStartupTwoA in order to check the interface 
		Expected result:  BP was set

Postcondition

	Step 5: Return ECU to default values
