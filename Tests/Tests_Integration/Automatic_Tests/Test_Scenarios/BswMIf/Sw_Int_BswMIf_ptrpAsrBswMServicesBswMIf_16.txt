Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

Action: ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrpAsrBswMServicesBswMIf_BswM_OnEnableTxPdu

	Step 2: Enable comunication 
		Expected result:  Comunication enable

	Step 3: Set a BP in function BswM_Action_BswMAction_ComM_EnableTxPduConfirmation in order to call BswM_OnEnableTxPdu function 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 4: Set a BP in function BswM_OnEnableTxPdu in order to check if Bus communication is available {reception aknowledge is received} 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 5: Set a BP in function BswM_Action_BswMAction_ComM_EnableTxPduConfirmation in order to check the interface 
		Expected result:  BP was set

Action: ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrpAsrOsServicesBswMIf_BswMIf_runMainFunction

	Step 6: Set a BP in OsTask_Alv_Autotests in order to call BswMIf_runMainFunction function 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 7: Set a BP in function BswMIf_runMainFunction in order to check if Os task {OsTask_Alv_Autotests} was executed 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 8: Set a BP in OsTask_Alv_Autotests in order to check the interface 
		Expected result:  BP was set

Action: ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrpAsrBswMServicesBswMIf_BswM_OnDisableTxPdu

	Step 9: Disable comunication 
		Expected result:  Comunication disable

	Step 10: Set a BP in function BswM_Action_BswMAction_ComM_DisableTxPduConfirmation in order call BswM_OnDisableTxPdu function 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 11: Set a BP in function BswM_OnDisableTxPdu in order to check Bus if Current state of ECU is RUN AND Bus communication timeout was received 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 12: Set a BP in function BswM_Action_BswMAction_ComM_DisableTxPduConfirmation in order to check the interface 
		Expected result:  BP was set

Postcondition

	Step 13: Return ECU to default values
