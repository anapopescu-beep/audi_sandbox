ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrpAsrBswMServicesBswMIf_BswM_OnPostRunFromRun: The BswM_OnPostRunFromRun runnable shall be called by the Autosar BswM in case of: - The current state of ECU is RUN AND Bus communication timeout is received
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

Action: ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrpAsrBswMServicesBswMIf_BswM_OnPostRunFromRun

	Step 2: Enable comunication 
		Expected result:  Comunication enable

	Step 3: Disable comunication 
		Expected result:  Comunication disable

	Step 4: Set a BP in function BswM_Action_BswMAction_BswM_PostRunStateFromRun in order to call BswM_OnPostRunFromRun function 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 5: Set a BP in function BswM_OnPostRunFromRun in order to check if The current state of ECU is RUN AND Bus communication timeout was received 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 6: Set a BP in function BswM_Action_BswMAction_BswM_PostRunStateFromRun in order to check the interface 
		Expected result:  BP was set

Postcondition

	Step 7: Return ECU to default values
