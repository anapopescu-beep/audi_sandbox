		Expected result:  Comunication enable

	Step 3: Disable comunication 
		Expected result:  Comunication disable

	Step 4: Set a BP in function BswM_Cyclic_10msTimer in order to go in  BswM_OnLowPwrFromPostRun function 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 5: Set a BP in function BswM_OnLowPwrFromPostRun in order to call BswM_RequestMode function 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 6: Set a BP in function BswM_RequestMode  in order to: - Set BswM EcuState Port to be able to notify that LOW POWER state is requested 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 7: Set a BP in function BswM_OnLowPwrFromPostRun for check the interface 
		Expected result:  BP was set

Action: ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrrBswMServicesBswMIf_BswM_RequestMode_BswM_OnRunFromLowPwrBusAvailable

	Step 8: Enable comunication 
		Expected result:  Comunication enable

	Step 9: Set a BP in function BswM_OnRunFromLowPwrBusAvailable in order to call BswM_RequestMode function 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 10: Set a BP in function BswM_RequestMode in order to: - Set BswM EcuState Port to be able to notify that RUN state is requested

	Step 11: Set a BP in function BswM_OnRunFromLowPwrBusAvailable for check the interface 
		Expected result:  BP was set
