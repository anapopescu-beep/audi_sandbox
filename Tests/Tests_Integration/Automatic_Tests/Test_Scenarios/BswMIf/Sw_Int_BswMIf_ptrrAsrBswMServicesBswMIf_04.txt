--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

Action: ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrrBswMServicesBswMIf_BswM_RequestMode_BswM_On_Prep_Shutdown

	Step 2: Send diagnostic request in order to do soft Reset

	Step 3: Set a BP in function BswM_ProceedReset in order to call BswM_On_Prep_Shutdown 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 4: Set a BP in BswM_RequestMode function in order to: - Request to start the process to fastened the WriteAll process - Set BswM Request Port to be able to notify that de-initialization of modules shall be performed 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 5: Set a BP in function BswM_CB_NfyNvMJobEnd for check the interface 
		Expected result:  BP was set

Action: ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrrBswMServicesBswMIf_BswM_RequestMode_BswM_OnGoOffOneA

	Step 6: Send diagnostic request in order to do soft Reset

	Step 7: Set a BP in function BswM_OnGoOffOneA in order call BswM_RequestMode function 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 8: Set a BP in BswM_RequestMode function in order to: - Set BswM Request Port to be able to notify that the second step of de-initialization of modules shall be performed 
		Expected result:  BP was set

Postcondition

	Step 9: Return ECU to default values
