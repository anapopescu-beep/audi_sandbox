ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrrBswMServicesBswMIf_BswM_RequestMode_BswM_Cyclic_10msTimer: The BswM_RequestMode runnable shall be called in the BswM_Cyclic_10msTimer runnable in order to: - Set BswM Passenger Occupancy port to notify that pasager occupancy was detected - Set BswM Passenger Occupancy port to notify that pasager occupancy was not detected - Set BswM ECU Shutdown Port to be able to notify that SHUTDOWN state is requested - Set BswM EcuState Port to be able to notify that LOW POWER state is requested - Set BswM EcuState Port to be able to notify that RUN state is requested - Set BswM TX PDU request port to notify that TX Pdu disable is requested
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

Action: ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrrBswMServicesBswMIf_BswM_RequestMode_BswM_Cyclic_10msTimer

	Step 2: Enable comunication 
		Expected result:  Comunication enable

	Step 3: Disable comunication 
		Expected result:  Comunication disable

	Step 4: Set a BP in function BswM_Cyclic_10msTimer in order to change post run timer value 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 5: Set a BP in function BswM_Cyclic_10msTimer in order to change Passenger Occupancy Status 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 6: Change value for Passenger Occupancy Status with pasager occupancy is detected
		Expected result:  Succesfully changed

	Step 7: Set a BP in function BswM_Cyclic_10msTimer in order to call BswM_RequestMode 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 8: Set a BP in function BswM_RequestMode in order to: - Set BswM Passenger Occupancy port to notify that pasager occupancy was detected - Set BswM Passenger Occupancy port to notify that pasager occupancy was not detected - Set BswM ECU Shutdown Port to be able to notify that SHUTDOWN state is requested - Set BswM EcuState Port to be able to notify that LOW POWER state is requested - Set BswM EcuState Port to be able to notify that RUN state is requested - Set BswM TX PDU request port to notify that TX Pdu disable is requested 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 9: Set a BP in function BswM_Cyclic_10msTimer in order to check the interface 
		Expected result:  BP was set

Postcondition

	Step 10: Return ECU to default values
