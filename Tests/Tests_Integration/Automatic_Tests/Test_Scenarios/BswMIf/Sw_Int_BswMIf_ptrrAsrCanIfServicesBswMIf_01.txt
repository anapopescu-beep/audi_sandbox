ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrrCanIfServicesBswMIf_CanIf_Init_BswM_OnStartupTwoA: The CanIf_Init runnable shall be called in the BswM_OnStartupTwoA runnable in order to initialize the CAN interface.
ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrrCanIfServicesBswMIf_CanIf_CheckWakeup_BswM_CB_NfyNvMJobEnd: The CanIf_CheckWakeup runnable shall be called in the BswM_CB_NfyNvMJobEnd runnable in order to check for wakeup events.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

Action: ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrrCanIfServicesBswMIf_CanIf_Init_BswM_OnStartupTwoA

	Step 2: Set a BP in function BswM_OnStartupTwoA to call CanIf_Init function 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 3: Set a BP in function CanIf_Init in order to initialize the CAN interface 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 4: Set a BP in function BswM_OnStartupTwoA for check the interface 
		Expected result:  BP was set

Action: ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrrCanIfServicesBswMIf_CanIf_CheckWakeup_BswM_CB_NfyNvMJobEnd

	Step 5: Set a BP in function BswM_CB_NfyNvMJobEnd to call CanIf_CheckWakeup function 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 6: Set a BP in function CanIf_CheckWakeup in order to check for wakeup events 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 7: Set a BP in function BswM_CB_NfyNvMJobEnd for check the interface 
		Expected result:  BP was set

Postcondition

	Step 8: Return ECU to default values
