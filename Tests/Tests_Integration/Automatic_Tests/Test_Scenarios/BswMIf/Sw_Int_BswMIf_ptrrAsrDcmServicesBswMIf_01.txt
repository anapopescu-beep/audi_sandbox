--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

Action: ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrrDcmServicesBswMIf_Dcm_Init_BswM_OnStartComEffective

	Step 2: Set a BP in function BswM_OnStartComEffective in order to call Dcm_Init function 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 3: Set a BP in function Dcm_Init in order to initialize DCM module 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 4: Set a BP in function BswM_OnStartComEffective in order to check the interface 
		Expected result:  BP was set

Postcondition

	Step 5: Return ECU to default values
