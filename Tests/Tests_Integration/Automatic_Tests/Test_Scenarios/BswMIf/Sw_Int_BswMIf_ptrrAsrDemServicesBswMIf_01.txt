--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

Action: ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrrDemServicesBswMIf_Dem_Init_BswM_OnStartupTwoB

	Step 2: Set a BP in function BswM_OnStartupTwoB in order call Dem_Init 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 3: Set a BP in function Dem_Init in order to initialize DEM module 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 4: Set a BP in function BswM_OnStartupTwoB for check the interface 
		Expected result:  BP was set

Action: ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrrDemServicesBswMIf_Dem_Shutdown_BswM_On_Prep_Shutdown

	Step 5: Send diagnostic request in order to do soft Reset

	Step 6: Set a BP in function BswM_ProceedReset in order to call BswM_On_Prep_Shutdown function 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 7: Set a BP in Dem_Shutdown in order to shutdown the DEM module 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 8: Set a BP in function BswM_CB_NfyNvMJobEnd for check the interface 
		Expected result:  BP was set

Postcondition

	Step 9: Return ECU to default values
