Requirement under test: ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrrFlsServicesBswMIf_Fls_MainFunction_OsTask_Bsw_ReadWrite_AllProcess
ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrrFlsServicesBswMIf_Fls_MainFunction_OsTask_Bsw_ReadWrite_AllProcess: The Fls_MainFunction runnable shall be called in the OsTask_Bsw_ReadWrite_AllProcess runnable in order to perform flash read/write/erase or compare fls jobs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

Action: ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrrFlsServicesBswMIf_Fls_MainFunction_OsTask_Bsw_ReadWrite_AllProcess

	Step 2: Set a BP in OsTask_Bsw_ReadWrite_AllProcess in order to call Fls_MainFunction 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 3: Set a BP in function Fls_MainFunction in order to perform flash read/write/erase or compare fls jobs 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 4: Set a BP in function OsTask_Bsw_ReadWrite_AllProcess to check the interface 
		Expected result:  BP was set

Postcondition

	Step 5: Return ECU to default values
