Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

Action: ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrrGptServicesBswMIf_Gpt_StopTimer_BswM_Cyclic_10msTimer

	Step 2: Enable comunication 
		Expected result:  Comunication enable

	Step 3: Disable comunication 
		Expected result:  Comunication disable

	Step 4: Set a BP in function BswM_Cyclic_10msTimer in order to change post run timer value 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 5: Set a BP in function BswM_Cyclic_10msTimer in order to change  Passenger Occupancy Status 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 6: Change value for Passenger Occupancy Status with pasager occupancy is detected
		Expected result:  Succesfully changed

	Step 7: Set a BP in function BswM_Cyclic_10msTimer in order to call Gpt_StopTimer 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 8: Set a BP in function Gpt_StopTimer in order to stop function of timer 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 9: Set a BP in function BswM_Cyclic_10msTimer in order to check the interface 
		Expected result:  BP was set

Postcondition

	Step 10: Return ECU to default values
