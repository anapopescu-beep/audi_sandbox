--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

Action: ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrrRteServicesBswMIf_Rte_Start_BswM_OnStartComEffective

	Step 2: Set a BP in function BswM_OnStartComEffective in order to start RTE services
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 3: Set a BP in function Rte_Start for check if interface work 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 4: Set a BP in function BswM_OnStartComEffective for check the interface 
		Expected result:  BP was set

Action: ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrrRteServicesBswMIf_Rte_Stop_BswM_On_Prep_Shutdown

	Step 5: Send diagnostic request in order to do soft Reset

	Step 6: Set a BP in function BswM_ProceedReset in order to call BswM_On_Prep_Shutdown and to stop RTE services  
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 7: Set a BP in Rte_Stop for check if BP is reached in order to stop RTE services 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 8: Set a BP in function BswM_CB_NfyNvMJobEnd for check the interface 
		Expected result:  BP was set

Postcondition

	Step 9: Return ECU to default values
