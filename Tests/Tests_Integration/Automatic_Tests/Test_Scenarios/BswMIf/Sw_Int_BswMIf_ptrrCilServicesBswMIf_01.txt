ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrrCilServicesBswMIf_CIL_runInit_BswM_OnStartComEffective:  The CIL_runInit runnable shall be called in the BswM_OnStartComEffective runnable in order to initialize CIL module
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

Action: ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrrCilServicesBswMIf_CIL_runInit_BswM_OnStartComEffective

	Step 2: Set a BP in function BswM_OnStartComEffective in order to initialize CIL module
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 3: Set a BP in function CIL_runInit for check if interface work 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 4: Set a BP in function BswM_OnStartComEffective for check the interface 
		Expected result:  BP was set

Postcondition

	Step 5: Return ECU to default values
