Action: ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrrLpmServicesBswMIf_LPM_sleepInit_BswM_OnLowPwrFromPostRun

	Step 2: Enable comunication 
		Expected result:  Comunication enable

	Step 3: Disable comunication 
		Expected result:  Comunication disable

	Step 4: Set a BP in function BswM_Cyclic_10msTimer in order to go in  BswM_OnLowPwrFromPostRun function 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 5: Set a BP in function BswM_OnLowPwrFromPostRun in order to initialize LPM module 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 6: Set a BP in function LPM_sleepInit for check the interface and initialize LPM module 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 7: Set a BP in function BswM_OnLowPwrFromPostRun for check the interface 
		Expected result:  BP was set

Postcondition

	Step 8: Return ECU to default values
