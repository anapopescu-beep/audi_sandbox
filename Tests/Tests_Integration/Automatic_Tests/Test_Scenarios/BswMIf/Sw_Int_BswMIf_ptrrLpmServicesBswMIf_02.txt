Requirement under test: ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrrLpmServicesBswMIf_LPM_sleepMainLoop_BswM_OnLowPwrFromPostRun, ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrrLpmServicesBswMIf_LPM_sleepRestore_BswM_OnLowPwrFromPostRun
ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrrLpmServicesBswMIf_LPM_sleepMainLoop_BswM_OnLowPwrFromPostRun: The LPM_sleepMainLoop runnable shall be called in the BswM_OnLowPwrFromPostRun runnable in order to enter in main loop and stay there until: - Passenger occupancy detected - Bus activity detected - TLowPower timeout
ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrrLpmServicesBswMIf_LPM_sleepRestore_BswM_OnLowPwrFromPostRun: The LPM_sleepRestore runnable shall be called in the BswM_OnLowPwrFromPostRun runnable in order to restore previous state and set rules to go back in RUN STATE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

Action: ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrrLpmServicesBswMIf_LPM_sleepMainLoop_BswM_OnLowPwrFromPostRun

	Step 2: Enable comunication 
		Expected result:  Comunication enable

	Step 3: Disable comunication 
		Expected result:  Comunication disable

	Step 4: Set a BP in function BswM_Cyclic_10msTimer in order to go in  BswM_OnLowPwrFromPostRun function 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 5: Change value for Post Run Timer in order to go in BswM_OnLowPwrFromPostRun function 
		Expected result:  Succesfully changed

	Step 6: Set a BP in function BswM_OnLowPwrFromPostRun in order to call LPM_sleepMainLoop 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 7: Set a BP in function LPM_sleepMainLoop in order to enter in main loop and stay there until: - Passenger occupancy detected - Bus activity detected - TLowPower timeout 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 8: Change value for lpm wakeup in order go out from while 
		Expected result:  Succesfully changed

Action: ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrrLpmServicesBswMIf_LPM_sleepRestore_BswM_OnLowPwrFromPostRun

	Step 9: Set a BP in function BswM_OnLowPwrFromPostRun in order to call LPM_sleepRestore 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 10: Set a BP in function LPM_sleepRestore in order to restore previous state and set rules to go back in RUN STATE

Postcondition

	Step 11: Return ECU to default values
