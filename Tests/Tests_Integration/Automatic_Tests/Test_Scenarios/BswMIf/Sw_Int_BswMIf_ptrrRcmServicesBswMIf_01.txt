Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

Action: ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrrRcmServicesBswMIf_RCM_runDetermineResetCause_BswM_OnStartComEffective

	Step 2: Set a BP in function BswM_OnStartComEffective  in order to determine the current reset cause 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 3: Set a BP in function RCM_runDetermineResetCause for check if interface work 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 4: Set a BP in function BswM_OnStartComEffective for check the interface 
		Expected result:  BP was set

Action: ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrrRcmServicesBswMIf_RCM_runConfirmResetCause_BswM_OnStartComEffective

	Step 5: Set a BP in function BswM_OnStartComEffective in order to confirm the detected reset cause 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 6: Set a BP in function RCM_runConfirmResetCause for check if interface work 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 7: Set a BP in function BswM_OnStartComEffective for check the interface 
		Expected result:  BP was set

Action: ARCH_SW_BswMIf_ptrrRcmServicesBswMIf_RCM_runGetResetCause_BswM_OnStartupTwoB

	Step 8: Set a BP in function BswM_OnStartupTwoB in order to check if a valid wake up event was detected 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 9: Set a BP in function RCM_runGetResetCause for check if interface work 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 10: Set a BP in function BswM_OnStartupTwoA for check the interface 
		Expected result:  BP was set

Postcondition
