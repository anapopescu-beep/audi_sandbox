Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

Action: ARCH_SW_CIL_P_CAN_CanDataOut_Frame_0

	Step 2: Start DevKit_01 Frame 
		Expected result:  Frame started.

	Step 3: Send request for Supplier session

	Step 4: Send request for  Supplier Security Access

	Step 5: Send request for press ECUUnlock button

	Step 6: Send request for Activate measurement frame

	Step 7: Set a breakpoint in function CIL_runAppliToCAN at the execution for the current time slot 
		Expected result:  BP reached.

	Step 8: Set a breakpoint in function cil_ManagePeriodicData_TimeSlot01 at the 1th timeslot 
		Expected result:  BP reached.

	Step 9: Run the debugger 1 times, in order to reach the 1st timeslot.

	Step 10: Set a breakpoint in function cil_ManagePeriodicData_TimeSlot01 after RTE Call Selected Profile 
		Expected result:  BP reached.

	Step 11: Read Selected Profile value. 
		Expected result: Selected Profile value succesfully read

	Step 12: Check that signal eCS_SelectedProfile_S1 value set  
		Expected result:  Signal is set

Postcondition

	Step 13: Return ECU to default values
