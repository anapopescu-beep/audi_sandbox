Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

Action: ARCH_SW_CIL_P_CAN_CanDataOut_Frame_0, ARCH_SW_CIL_P_CAN_MF_Frame

	Step 2: Start DevKit_01 Frame 
		Expected result:  Frame started.

	Step 3: Send request for Supplier session

	Step 4: Send request for  Supplier Security Access

	Step 5: Send request for press ECUUnlock button

	Step 6: Send request for Activate measurement frame

	Step 7: Set a breakpoint in function CIL_runAppliToCAN at the execution for the current time slot 
		Expected result:  BP reached.

	Step 8: Set a breakpoint in function cil_ManagePeriodicData_TimeSlot02 at the 2nd timeslot 
		Expected result:  BP reached.

	Step 9: Run the debugger 2 times, in order to reach the 2nd timeslot.

	Step 10: Set a breakpoint in function cil_ManagePeriodicData_TimeSlot02 after RTE Read for ball position in mm 
		Expected result:  BP reached.

	Step 11: Read Ball_Position in mm from debugger 
		Expected result:  Variable read.

	Step 12: Read value of signal Ball_Position 
		Expected result:  Signal value read.

Postcondition

	Step 13: Return ECU to default values
