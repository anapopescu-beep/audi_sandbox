--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

Action: ARCH_SW_DIA_pseDID_4024_SWSystemTime

	Step 2: Send diagnostic request in order to go in Supplier Session

	Step 3: Send request for press Supplier Security Access button

	Step 4: Send diagnostic request in order to do SW System Time Read

	Step 5: Set a BP in function BswM_OnPostRunFromRun in order to call STM_runReadAbsoluteSystemTime function 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 6: Set a BP in function BswM_Action_BswMAction_BswM_RunStateFromPostRunBusAvailable in order to read the absolute system time 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 7: Set a BP in function DIA_runDid4024_SWSystemTimeRead in order to check the interface 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 8: Read the system time value 
		Expected result:  system time value is 4 bytes of data + 1 byte reserved

Postcondition

	Step 9: Return ECU to default values
