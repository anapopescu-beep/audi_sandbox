--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

Action: ARCH_SW_DIA_pseDID_FD10_MCUTemperature

	Step 2: Send diagnostic request in order to go in Supplier Session

	Step 3: Send request for press Supplier Security Access button

	Step 4: Send request for press Supplier Security Access button

	Step 5: Send diagnostic request in order to read MCU Temperature Measure

	Step 6: Set a BP in function DIA_run_DidFD10_MCUTemperatureRead in order to call IoHwAb_runGetMeasure 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 7: Set a BP in function IoHwAb_GetMcuTemperature in order start temperature Measuremant 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 8: Set a BP in function DIA_run_DidFD10_MCUTemperatureRead in order to read MCU Temperature Measure 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 9: Read Temperature Input value 
		Expected result:  Temperature Input succesfully read

Postcondition

	Step 10: Return ECU to default values
