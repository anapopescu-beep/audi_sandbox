--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

Action: ARCH_SW_DIA_pseDID_FD62_EccOccurenceNb

	Step 2: Set a BP in function atm_cbk_RunPFlashMemoryCorruption_MIC_Autotest in order to call MIC_Autotest_RunPFlashMemoryCorruption function 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 3: Set a BP in function MIC_Autotest_RunPFlashMemoryCorruption in order to confirm the detected reset cause 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 4: Modify Reset Cause value in order to detect ECC 
		Expected result:  Reset cause value is set.

	Step 5: Send diagnostic request in order to go in Supplier Session

	Step 6: Send request for press Supplier Security Access button

	Step 7: Send diagnostic request in order to read the number of ECCs

	Step 8: Set a BP in function DIA_runDidFD62_EccOccurenceNbRead in order read the number of ECCs 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 9: Read the number of ECCs value  
		Expected result:  Nlumber of ECCs succesfully read

Postcondition

	Step 10: Return ECU to default values
