Test type: Requirement-Based
Regression Test: No
Fault injection method used: No
Resource usage evaluation: No
Priority: No
Safety relevant: No
Requirement under test: ARCH_SW_DIA_pseDID_FDE4_EcsSteps_WriteData, ARCH_SW_DIA_pseDID_FDE4_EcsSteps_ReadData
ARCH_SW_DIA_pseDID_FDE4_EcsSteps_WriteData: nterface used to write the eCS steps definition (8 * 4 bytes).
ARCH_SW_DIA_pseDID_FDE4_EcsSteps_ReadData: Interface used to read ECS steps configuration n * 4 bytes. (n = 8 steps). First byte is duration MSB, second byte duration LSB, third byte is PWM order and forth byte is options.
