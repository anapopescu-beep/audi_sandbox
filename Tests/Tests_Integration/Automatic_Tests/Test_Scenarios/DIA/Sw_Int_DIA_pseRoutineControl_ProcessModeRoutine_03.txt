--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

Action: ARCH_SW_DIA_pseRoutineControl_ProcessMode_RequestRes

	Step 2: Set a BP in function Dcm_DcmDspRoutineProcessMode_RequestResults in order to call Rte_Call_RoutineServices_DcmDspRoutineProcessMode_RequestResults function 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 3: Send diagnostic request in order to go in Supplier Session

	Step 4: Send request for press Supplier Security Access button

	Step 5: Send request for press ECUUnlock button

	Step 6: Send diagnostic request in order to start the Process Mode 

	Step 7: Send diagnostic request in order to stop the Process Mode 

	Step 8: Send diagnostic request in order to Process Mode Request Results

	Step 9: Set a BP in function Rte_Call_Dcm_RoutineServices_DcmDspRoutineProcessMode_RequestResults in order to call DIA_runRidF793_ProcessModeRequestRes. 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 10: Set a BP in function DIA_runRidF793_ProcessModeRequestRes  in order to requuest result for Process Mode. 
		Expected result:  BP was set

Postcondition

	Step 11: Return ECU to default values
