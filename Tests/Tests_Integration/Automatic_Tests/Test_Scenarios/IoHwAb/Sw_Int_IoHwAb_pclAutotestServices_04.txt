--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

Action: ARCH_SW_IoHwAb_pclAutotestServices_IoHwAb_CheckEcuOverTemperatureAutotest

	Step 2: Set a BP in function atm_cbk_runOverTemperature in order to call IoHwAb_CheckEcuOverTemperatureAutotest function 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 3: Set a BP in function IoHwAb_CheckEcuOverTemperatureAutotest in order to change MCU Temperature 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 4: Write MCU Temperature 
		Expected result:  MCU Temperature succesfully write

	Step 5: Set a BP in function IoHwAb_CheckEcuOverTemperatureAutotest in order check if the auto test result is OK 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 6: Set a BP in function atm_cbk_runOverTemperature in order check the auto test result is OK 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 7: Read aoto test result 
		Expected result:  Auto test result succesfully read

Postcondition

	Step 8: Return ECU to default values
