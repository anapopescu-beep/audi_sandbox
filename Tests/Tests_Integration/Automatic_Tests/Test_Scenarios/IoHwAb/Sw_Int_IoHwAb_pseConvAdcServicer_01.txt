--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

Action: ARCH_SW_IoHwAb_pseConvAdcService, ARCH_SW_DIA_pclConvAdcService

	Step 2: Set a breakpoint in function DIA_run_DidFD10_MCUTemperatureRead at Rte_Call_pclConvAdcService_getMeasure interface call 
		Expected result:  BP reached.

	Step 3: Send diagnostic request in order to go in Supplier Session

	Step 4: Send request for press Supplier Security Access button

	Step 5: Send diagnostic request in order to start the Temp Calibration

	Step 6: Set a breakpoint in function IoHwAb_runGetMeasure. 
		Expected result:  BP reached

	Step 7: Set a breakpoint in function DIA_run_DidFD10_MCUTemperatureRead at return 
		Expected result:  BP reached.

Postcondition

	Step 8: Return ECU to default values
