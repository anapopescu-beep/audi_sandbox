Nightly test: No
Test type: Requirement-Based, Interface Test
Regression Test: No
Fault injection method used: No
Resource usage evaluation: No
Priority: No
Safety relevant: No
Requirement under test: ARCH_SW_IoHwAb_pseConvAdcService, ARCH_SW_CIL_pclConvAdcService
ARCH_SW_IoHwAb_pseConvAdcService: The runnable shall read the {Raw value} in LSB via the AdcIf_runGetChannelValue interface for the selected {Measurement Index}
ARCH_SW_CIL_pclConvAdcService: Interface is used to read physical measurements in SI units - Interface will be used to read the voltage (mV) on each solenoid - Interface will be used to read the current (mA) on each solenoid

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Start MF 01 
		Expected result:  MF Started

Action: ARCH_SW_IoHwAb_pseConvAdcService, ARCH_SW_CIL_pclConvAdcService

	Step 3: Set a breakpoint in function cil_Update_07Cx_Block01_InfosToSend at Rte_Call for runGetMeasure. 
		Expected result:  BP reached

	Step 4: Set a breakpoint in function IoHwAb_runGetMeasure 
		Expected result:  BP reached

	Step 5: Set a breakpoint in function cil_Update_07Cx_Block01_InfosToSend 
		Expected result:  BP reached

Postcondition

	Step 6: Return ECU to default values
