Nightly test: No
Test type: Requirement-Based, Interface Test
Regression Test: No
Fault injection method used: No
Resource usage evaluation: No
Priority: No
Safety relevant: No
Requirement under test: ARCH_SW_CIL_rrSeatOccupancySensorStatus, ARCH_SW_IoHwAb_psrSeatOccupancySensorStatus
ARCH_SW_CIL_rrSeatOccupancySensorStatus: Interface used to read the seat sensor status for the second row.
ARCH_SW_IoHwAb_psrSeatOccupancySensorStatus: The runnable shall the voltage level of the {Wake channel 1} and {Wake channel 2} via the input parameters. The runnable shall set the {Seat Occupancy Status 1} and {Seat Occupancy Status 2} depending on the resistance values computed from the input parameters.

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

Action: ARCH_SW_CIL_rrSeatOccupancySensorStatus, ARCH_SW_IoHwAb_psrSeatOccupancySensorStatus

	Step 2: Set a breakpoint in function IoHwAb_DetectSeatOccupancy 
		Expected result:  BP reached.

	Step 3: Write Local au8RteSeat with value 1 
		Expected result:  Variable overwritten with 0x1.

	Step 4: Set a breakpoint in function CIL_runAppliToCAN at the execution of the current time slot

	Step 5: Set a breakpoint in function cil_ManagePeriodicData_TimeSlot04 after getting getting feedback from Seat Occupancy Sensors.

	Step 6: Evaluate seat sensor data flow

Postcondition

	Step 7: Return ECU to default values
