Test type: Requirement-Based
Regression Test: No
Fault injection method used: No
Resource usage evaluation: No
Priority: No
Safety relevant: No
Requirement under test: ARCH_SW_MIC_pclNvmIfServices_SetRamBlockStatus
ARCH_SW_MIC_pclNvmIfServices_SetRamBlockStatus: The NvmIfServices_SetRamBlockStatus interface will set a flag, flag used to notify that the ECC Counters Block has to be recorded in the EEPROM during the shutdown. (The writhing procces will be done in NvM_WriteAll();)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

Action: ARCH_SW_MIC_pclNvmIfServices_SetRamBlockStatus

	Step 2: Set a BP in function MIC_Autotest_RunRamMemoryCorruption in order to change value of reset cause 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 3: Modify Reset Cause value in order to detect ECC 
		Expected result:  Reset cause value is set.

	Step 4: Set a BP in function MIC_Autotest_RunRamMemoryCorruption in order to call NvmIf_SetRamBlockStatus function 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 5: Set a BP in function NvmIf_SetRamBlockStatus in order to check the interface 
		Expected result:  BP was set

Postcondition

	Step 6: Return ECU to default values
