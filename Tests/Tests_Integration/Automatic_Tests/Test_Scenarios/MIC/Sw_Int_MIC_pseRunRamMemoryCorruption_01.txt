		Expected result:  auto test result is OK

	Step 6: Set a BP in function atm_cbk_RunRamMemoryCorruption_MIC_Autotest in order to call MIC_Autotest_RunRamMemoryCorruption function 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 7: Set a BP in function MIC_Autotest_RunRamMemoryCorruption in order to confirm the detected reset cause 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 8: Modify Reset Cause value in order to detect ECC 
		Expected result:  Reset cause value is set.

	Step 9: Set a BP in function atm_cbk_RunRamMemoryCorruption_MIC_Autotest in order to check the interface 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 10: Read auto test result
