Nightly test: No
Test type: Requirement-Based
Regression Test: No
Fault injection method used: No
Resource usage evaluation: No
Priority: No
Safety relevant: No
Requirement under test: ARCH_SW_SAD_pseCheckSolenoidShortToGND_SAD_CheckSolenoidShortToGNDAutotest
ARCH_SW_SAD_pseCheckSolenoidShortToGND_SAD_CheckSolenoidShortToGNDAutotest: The auto-test shall detect for all conected and configured solenoids if they have electrical . - In order to detect an open-circuit hardware fault, all measurements on solenoid ADC lines shall be done with unlock profile or diagnostic profile active. - If the measured solenoid voltage is different than NVP_u16ShortToGNDUnlockProfThrs when unlock profile is active, than autotest shall return OK. - If the measured solenoid voltage is equal to NVP_u16ShortToGNDUnlockProfThrs when unlock profile is active, than autotest shall return NOK. - If the measured solenoid voltage is different than NVP_u16ShortToGNDDiagProfThrs when diagnostic profile is active, than autotest shall return OK. - If the measured solenoid voltage is equal to NVP_u16ShortToGNDDiagProfThrs when diagnostic profile is active, than autotest shall return NOK. - If unlock profile or diagnostic profile is not active, than autotest shall return last valid autotest result.

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

Action: ARCH_SW_SAD_pseCheckSolenoidShortToGND_SAD_CheckSolenoidShortToGNDAutotest

	Step 2: Set a BP in function SAD_CheckSolenoidShortToGNDAutotest in order to call sad_CheckSolenoidOpenCircuitAutotest function 
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 3: Send diagnostic request in order to go in Supplier Session

	Step 4: Send request for press Supplier Security Access button

	Step 5: Send request for press ECUUnlock button

	Step 6: Set a BP in function SAD_CheckSolenoidShortToGNDAutotest in order to check if auto test result is ok
		Expected result:  BP was set

	Step 7: Read Result of Test value  
		Expected result:  Result Of Test succesfully read

Postcondition

	Step 8: Return ECU to default values
