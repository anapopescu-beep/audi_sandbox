1. Example Description
    The example perform basic functionality of Fee driver.
    1.1 The application software functionality
            - Initialize Fls driver
            - Initialize Fee driver
            - Write 4 data bytes to the block 0.
            - Read 2 byte from offset 2 in the block 0.
            - Check received data.

2. Installation steps
    2.1 Hardware installation
        2.1.1 Supported boards
            - S32K118EVB2-Q048 PCB 47530 RevX1 SCH RevA1
        2.1.2 Connections
            - There are no specific connections needed
        2.1.3 Debugger
            - PnE debugger on board is used. The micro-USB must be connected to J7 (USB port)
    2.2 Software installation
        2.2.1 Importing the S32 Design Studio project
            After opening S32 Design Studio, go to "File -> New -> S32DS Project From Example" and select this example. Then click on "Finish".
            The project should now be copied into you current workspace.

3. Generating, building and running the example application
    3.1 Generating the S32 configuration
        Before running the example a configuration needs to be generated.  First go to Project Explorer View in S32 DS and select the current project. Select the "S32 Configuration Tool" menu then click on the desired configuration tool (Pins, Clocks, Peripherals etc...). Clicking on any one of those will generate all the components. Make the desired changes(if any) then click on the "S32 Configuration Tool->Update Code" button.
    3.2 Compiling the application
        Select the configuration to be built: FLASH (Debug_FLASH) by left clicking on the downward arrow corresponding to the build button in eclipse.
        Use Project > Build to build the project.
        Wait for the build action to be completed before continuing to the next step. Check the compiler console for error messages; upon completion, the *.elf binary file
        should be created.
    3.3 Running the application on the board
        Go to Run and select Debug Configurations. There will be a debug configuration for this project:

        Configuration Name                      | Description
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Fee_Example_S32K118_Debug_FLASH_PNE     | Debug the FLASH configuration using PnE Debugger

        Select the desired debug configuration and click on Launch. Now the perspective will change to the Debug Perspective.
        Use the controls to control the program flow.
