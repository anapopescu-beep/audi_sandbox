    @brief Example application showing SAI and FLEXIO_I2S IPs usage

    ## Application description ##
    _____
    The purpose of this demo application is to show the usage of the I2S driver found on the S32K148 SoC SAI IP and Flexio_I2s Ip.

    The application uses I2S driver to make a data transfer of a defined size. FLEXIO_I2S shall be master and SAI 0 instance shall be slave.
    User can see other settings for SAI and FLEXIO_I2S in S32 Configuration tool.
    To check if data is transferred correctly, put break point or let program run for about 2 seconds, then see if RecvData content is the same as SendData.

    How the example works:
    - If all conditions are correct, the code goes to the end of program without stuck in loop

    ## Prerequisites ##
    _____
    To run the example you will need to have the following items:
    - S32K148EVB-Q176 29644 PCB RevX1 SCH RevB
    - 1 Power adapter for the board
    - 1 Micro-USB cable (OpenSDA PnE on board is used)

    ## Boards supported ##

    ## How to run ##
    ______
    #### 1. Importing the project into the workspace ####
    After opening S32 Design Studio, go to \b File -> \b New \b S32DS \b Project \b From... and select \b Flexio_to_Sai_Ip_example_S32K148. Then click on \b Finish. \n
    The project should now be copied into you current workspace.
    #### 2. Generating the S32 configuration ####
    The example will run without an active configuration, however if any changes are required, a configuration needs to be generated.
    The initial configuration will have the same settings as the default example settings.
    First go to \b Project \b Explorer View in S32 DS and select the current project(\b Flexio_to_Sai_Ip_example_S32K148).
    Select the "S32 Configuration Tool" menu then click on the desired configuration tool (Pins, Clocks, Peripherals etc...). Clicking on any one of those will generate all the components.
    Make the desired changes(if any) then click on the "S32 Configuration Tool->Update Code" button.
    #### 3. Building the project ####
    Select the configuration to be built \b FLASH (Debug_FLASH) by left clicking on the downward arrow corresponding to the \b build button(@image hammer.png).
    Wait for the build action to be completed before continuing to the next step.
    #### 4. Running the project ####
    Go to \b Run and select \b Debug \b Configurations. There will be a debug configuration for this project:
     Configuration Name                                  | Description
     ----------------------------------------------------|------------
     \b Flexio_to_Sai_Ip_example_S32K148_Debug_FLASH_PNE | Debug the FLASH configuration using GDB PEMicro: OpenSDA Embedded Debug - USB Port

    \n Select the desired debug configuration and click on \b Launch. Now the perspective will change to the \b Debug \b Perspective. \n
    Use the controls to control the program flow.
