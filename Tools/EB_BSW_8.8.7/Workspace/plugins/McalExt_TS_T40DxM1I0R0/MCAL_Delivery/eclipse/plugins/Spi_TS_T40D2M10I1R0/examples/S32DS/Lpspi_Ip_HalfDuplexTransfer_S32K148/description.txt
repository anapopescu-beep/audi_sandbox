1. Example Description
    This application demonstrates the usage of LPSPI driver in Real Time Drivers.
    The application includes a Design Studio project, that uses predefined configurations for the IP layer only (Clock, Pin, Siul2, OsIf, Lpspi, IntCtrl).
    The application uses the LPSPI driver to transfer 10 frames in between 2 LPSPI physical units in half-duplex mode.

    1.1 The application software functionality
            - Clock_Ip_Init
                    Initialize the clock sources, the clock tree and to configure the clock gating of the peripherals.
            - Siul2_Port_Ip_Init
                    Initializes the pins used by the application using the Siul2_Port API.
            - IntCtrl_Ip_Init
                    Enable and set priority interrupt vectors configured on peripherals configuration tool.
            - IntCtrl_Ip_ConfigIrqRouting
                    Install handler for the configured interrupts.
            - Lpspi_Ip_Init
                    Initializes the LPSPI physical unit with its configuration data.
            - Lpspi_Ip_UpdateTransferMode
                    Select polling or interrupt mode in transfer.
            - Lpspi_Ip_AsyncTransmit
                    Prepare buffers of slave Spi and wait master start transfer.
            - Lpspi_Ip_SyncTransmit
                    Master start transfer with the slave by synchronous mode.
            - Lpspi_Ip_GetStatus
                    Get state of the instance

    1.2 The application description
            - The application uses the SPI driver to transfer data in half-duplex mode
            - Transfer 10 frames 8 bits via LPSPI0(MASTER) and 10 frames 8 bits via LPSPI1(SLAVE)

        2.1.3 Debugger
            PNE Debugger (optional, users can use Open SDA)

    2.2 Software installation
        2.2.1 Importing the S32 Design Studio project
            After opening S32 Design Studio, go to "File -> New -> S32DS Project From Example" and select "Lpspi_Ip_HalfDuplexTransfer_S32K148". Then click on "Finish".
            The project should now be copied into you current workspace.

3. Building the example application
    3.1 Generation the code by switch to Peripherals/Pin/Clock tools and click the button "Update Code"
    3.2 Compiling the application
        Select the configuration to be built: RAM (Debug_RAM), or FLASH (Debug_FLASH) by left clicking on the downward arrow corresponding to the build button in eclipse. 
        Wait for the build action to be completed before continuing to the next step. Check the compiler console for error messages; upon completion, Lpspi_Ip_HalfDuplexTransfer_S32K148.elf binary file
        should be created.
    3.3 Running the application on the board
        Click button "Run" or "Debug" on S32 Design Studio.
