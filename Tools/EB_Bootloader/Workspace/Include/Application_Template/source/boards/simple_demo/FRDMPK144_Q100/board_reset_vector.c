/* board_reset_vector.c
 *
 *	This file contains the reset vector for S32K14X:
 *	reset vector is two 32-bit words, linked to a hardware-specific location,
 *	that tell the hardware:
 *		1) Reset value of main stack pointer
 *		2) Address of the boardResetStart function
 *
 *	Usually this is not needed, because by default the reset vector is part of the interrupt table
 *	(See CORTEXM-exceptiontable.s). However, because of the S32K14X memory layout the interrupt
 *	table is relocated and the reset vector must be provided separately.
